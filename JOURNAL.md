## 10/3/2025 - Did lots of planning  

Okay, so. the first part of any project is to plan! I like to use as few breakouts as possible for space efficiency/general coolness. Which is something you should keep in mind.

# Micro-controllers
Okay, so I had a few options for micro-controllers. The common options are:
- ESP32
- ESP8266
- RP2040
- RP2350

I quickly discounted the RP2350 for it being more expensive and harder to use, but not giving any benefit. I then discounted the ESP\* series of chips due to general inexperience with the platform, but also the power inefficiency of them. the reduced part requirement would have been nice though.

# Power
I very quickly chose USB PD for this project, whilst this is more expensive than a traditional 12v supply, and harder than a 5v supply. It gives me slightly more flexibility, additionally. PD means that I can use 20V supplies, which should put the boost converter in less strain.
I did consider a step-down converter though, since the UK runs at 230V (tubes run at 170v) but I discounted this for a mix of higher voltages and needing to handle AC/DC conversion.

# The Tubes!
I went for 6x IN-16 tubes because I think they are the smallest/cheapest tubes that would look good standing up. It also happens that they are easily purchasable on eBay.

# Tube Controller
I thought long and hard about this. I had 2 real options:
- Use the original driver IC's (pros: Simpler to use, Cons: Only avaliable on eBay, Expensive, Need 1 per tube)
- Use Microchips's HV5122 / HV5222 (pros: Harder to use, Cons: Kinda hard to get, Only need 1, Harder to solder

In the end, I chose to use Microchip's HV5122 for the simplified wiring, despite it not being avaliable at LCSC (where most of my parts are coming from) but this could change later as I re-evaluate the ebay listings closer to the time.

Who doesn't like a diagram :P
